I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science, advised by [Huijia (Rachel) Lin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rachel/) and [Stefano Tessaro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/). My primary research interest lies in cryptography.

Prior to joining [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, I was a Ph.D. student at [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://cs.ucsb.edu/) for a quarter. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), where I attended [Yao class](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
