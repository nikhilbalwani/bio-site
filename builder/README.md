I am a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science, advised by [Rachel (Huijia) Lin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rachel/) and [Stefano Tessaro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/). My primary research interest is cryprography and I’m also interested in security and computational complexity.

Prior to joining [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, I was a Ph.D. student at [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://cs.ucsb.edu/) for a quarter. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), where I attended [Yao class](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

abstract="We introduce a new technique that allows to give a zero-knowledge proof that a committed vector has Hamming weight bounded by a given constant. The proof has unconditional soundness and is very compact: It has size independent of the length of the committed string, and for large fields, it has size corresponding to a constant number of commitments. We show five applications of the technique that play on a common theme, namely that our proof allows us to get malicious security at small overhead compared to semi-honest security: (1) actively secure k-out-of-n OT from black-box use of 1-out-of-2 OT, (2) separable accountable ring signatures, (3) more efficient preprocessing for the TinyTable secure two-party computation protocol, (4) mixing with public verifiability, and (5) PIR with security against a malicious client.",
